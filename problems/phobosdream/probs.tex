\subsection{Problem 1}

This problem comes from the 2023 GRE Mathematics Test Practice Book available from ETS.

In the complex plane, let $C$ be the circle $\{ z = 1 + e^{i\theta} : 0 \le \theta \le 2\pi\}$, oriented counterclockwise. What is the value of $\frac{1}{2 \pi i} \int_{C} \left( \frac{\sin z}{z - 1} \right)^2\,dz$?

\subsubsection*{Solution}

Let $f(z) = \left( \frac{\sin z}{z - 1} \right)^2$ which is a holomorphic function with a non-essential singularity (or pole) at $z=1$ with order 2. The contour integral over the circle can be calculated by leveraging the {\em{residue theorem}} which in our case for one singularity states

\begin{align}
  \int_{C} f(z)\, dz = 2 \pi i \, I(C,1) \, \operatorname{Res}(f,1) = 2 \pi i \, \operatorname{Res}(f,1).
\end{align}

$I(C,1)$ is the winding number at $z=1$, which is equal to 1 since the curve $C$ winds around the point counterclockwise a single time. $\operatorname{Res}(f,1)$ is the residue of $f$ at $z=1$ which can be found via the following limit approaching the pole

\begin{align}
  \operatorname{Res}(f,1)
    &= \lim_{z \rightarrow 1} \, \frac{d}{dz} \left[ \left(z - 1\right)^2 \cdot \frac{sin^2 z}{(z-1)^2} \right] \\
    &= \lim_{z \rightarrow 1} 2 \sin z \cos z \\
    &= 2 \sin 1 \cos 1 \\
    &= \sin 2.
\end{align}

Now the integral from the problem can be evaluated

\begin{align}
  \frac{1}{2 \pi i} \int_{C} f(z)\,dz
    = \frac{2 \pi i}{2 \pi i} \operatorname{Res}(f,1)
    = \operatorname{Res}(f,1)
    = \sin(2)
    \approx 0.708.
\end{align}
