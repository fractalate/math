Welcome to my 2024 problem set, a collection of math problems that I encountered and found interesting throughout the year.
I hope you find them challenging and enjoy solving these as much as I did!

I found this problem in the GRE Mathematics Test Practice Book for 2023 available from ETS.

In the complex plane, let $C$ be the circle $\{ z = 1 + e^{i\theta} : 0 \le \theta \le 2\pi\}$, oriented counterclockwise. What is the value of $\frac{1}{2 \pi i} \int_{C} \left( \frac{\sin z}{z - 1} \right)^2\,dz$?
