# Open Mathematics

Welcome to my open mathematics research! I believe mathematical ideas should be shared freely, so I work on my projects openly and I hope that you find something interesting.

Here's what I've been working on:

* [Polynomial Roots Iteration](./research/polynomial_roots/README.md) - What happens when you use the roots of a polynomial for the coefficients of a new polynomial?

## Papers

Here are some papers I've written:

* [Convex Split-Face Polygon Cuts (PDF, 2022)](./papers/convex_split_face_polygon_cuts/csfpc.pdf)

## Problems

You can find my work on individual problems, like those from competitions or problem-of-the-week lists, in the [Problems](./problems/README.md) directory.

You can find my collection of [Problems from 2024 (PDF)](./problems/phobosdream/probs.pdf) here.

## Notes

Here are my notes on a few topics:

* [Linear Integer Programming (Notebook)](./notes/linear_integer_programming.ipynb)
* [Standard Deviation (Notebook)](./notes/standard_deviation.ipynb)
